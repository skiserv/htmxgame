# HTMX Game also known as "Yet Another Space Game"

## Description

This game was started as a frame to test [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) technology. It moved away until a almost working really basic web browser persistent universe multiplayer space game (also called ogame-like).

You can find a public instance to try it at [space.skiserv.eu/](https://space.skiserv.eu/). Feel free to create issues or even pull requests to contribute here.
